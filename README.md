# nextstrain-hpai-north-america

This repository contains files for constructing nextstrain builds with additional metadata designations relevant to the current high path avian influenza in North America found [here](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha).

Metadata files have been modified to add migratory flyway assignments, as well as higher resolution species and order data, using the script and csv files available within the metadata_mod_scripts folder.
