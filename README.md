# nextstrain-hpai-north-america

This repo is for scripts and config files for nextstrain builds for HPAI in North America.

This repository contains files for constructing nextstrain builds for high path avian influenza found [here](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha).

Metadata files have been modified to add migratory flyway assignments to sequences, as well as higher resolution species and order data, using the script and csv files available within the metadata_mod_scripts folder.
